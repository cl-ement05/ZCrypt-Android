## 
So when I released [ZCrypt V4.1](https://github.com/cl-ement05/ZCrypt/releases/tag/V4.1), 
I thought that it would be great if people could interact with ZCrypt with a *real* UI and not from a Python commandline. Moreover, the Google I/O 2021 took place some days
before releasing V4.1 and they announced [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) would go stable in July.
Since I was very curious both about this new UI library and the Kotlin language, well I started this journey of creating an android app.

For more details about zcrypt please read the [manual of the master branch](https://github.com/cl-ement05/ZCrypt/blob/master/UserManual.md)

Feel free to make suggestions or even commit improvements

I hope you enjoy it !
